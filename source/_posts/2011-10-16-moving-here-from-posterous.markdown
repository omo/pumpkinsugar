Finally I gave up my [Posterous site](http://pumpkinsugar.posterous.com/)
and moved here. 
I love posterous in certain perspective. 
But it is too slow and I feel it's getting worse. 
I don't want any social features for this kind of notes.

I once tried Jekyll as [kzys](http://8-p.info/)'s recommendation.
But it was too much work just for posting my personal writing.
Octopress though, looks easier and well done. 

I'm a conservative man. So before trying by myself, 
I recommended it to a friend as a canary. 
Honestly I didn't have such an expectation. 
But a bit surprisingly, he liked it. What a *obvious* and positive signal!

Then I'm taking my turn ;-)
