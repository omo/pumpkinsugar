Yes, I'm back... and my weight is back. This week, It's 75.2kg now.

I'm doing some exersize. The exersize is just a lighter version of last 7reduce attempt. 
I'm also restarting a dictation, and will finish it at the end of this week. 

These days I'm thinking about revamping my ESL learning method since
the daily dication haven't improved my ESL ability so much.
For now, my learning method is one old by a friend of mine.
He is a kind of expert of language learning.
But a feeling tells me that it's time to figure it out by myself.

I ordered some textbook to see what other people are doing.
