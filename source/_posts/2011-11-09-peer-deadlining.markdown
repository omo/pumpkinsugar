I'd declare that *I'll launch the first version of my new Webapp within 30 days*.
This is my next 30days experiment: Peer deadlining, or 30build.

For a long time, I've been thinking to make a simple Webapp.
It's so simple that an experienced web developer could implement it in a day.
I tried to do it several times, but failed for some reasons.
One of the reason is, I guess, my lack of focus. 
And this experiment is to overcome it.

Hopefully, this will generate a certain pressure and encourage me to code,
instead of wasting time with the social media.

Anyway, here is a rule:

* I'll write a daily report of the project here. 
* Stretch: The report should include some numbers like loc delta.
* The deadline is 9th Dec.

The penalty and exception:

* Each time I skip the report without prior announcement, I'll donate 1000JPY for [Tohoku](http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html).
* If I cannot release any dogfood-able software until the deadline, I'll donate 5000JPY.
* Anytime I can declare the failure and finish this experiment. It'll also result a 5000JPY donation.

(By the way, I was considering to donate for the flood at Thailand. 
But I couldn't find any reliable, easy-to-pay account for that.)

What I'm going to build
-------------------------

OK. So what am I thinking about the App?

It will be yet another [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) implementation. 
It can be used to show and manage flashcard-like edited vocabulary exercises.
Sounds easy? I think so. Basically it's just a CRUD. 
The only problem is the fact that I'm just a newbie weekend Web developer.

The app will be called "Blank Bracket", or blbr.
