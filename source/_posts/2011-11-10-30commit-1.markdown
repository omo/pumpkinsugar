I planned to push the changes. But it's failed for SSH related error.
I'll retry it tomorrow.

Done:

 * Did setup the App Engine SDK.
 * Upload an stub app: http://blankbracket.appspot.com/ .
 * Installed [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the latest node and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (for CoffeeScript and Less).
   * Installed `coffee-script`, `less`.
 * Added [Bootstrap CSS](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) to our pages.

Some notes:

 * GAE SDK doesn't include built-in libraries for Python 2.7. I installed it to my python environment.
 * I thought to use something like RVM (for Python). But I'm installing packages to the system for now to avoid yaks.

Tomorrow:

 * Add a stub JS file
 * Setup a test page with Qunit.
 * More.
