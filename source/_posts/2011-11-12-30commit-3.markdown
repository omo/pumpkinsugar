I don't like python. For me, it's a language for the App Engine. Nothing more.
A remarkable characteristics of python is that we can use it even if we don't like it.
The language expressiveness is fairly limited. But there are fewer pitfalls, in price of the limitation.


Done/Doing:

 * Finished stub. 
 * Implemented User model and controller
 * Started implementing Card model and controller
 * Investigating Batman.js.

Note:

 * My microframework doesn't support collection-like RESTic access yet. I should figure out how to handle it cleanly.
