A friend of mine visited my room and we had one-day hackathon, which resulted a good progress. 
A basic CRUD for the primary model (Card) works now. 
I'll start to work on the 'exercise mode' tomorrow.

By the way, I started using batman.js.
My first pression is that it's a well-written and well-designed framework,
even though it has rough edges and I feel it a bit too complicated.
And what more important for me is: This is the first time I feel certain level of confidence of JS coding.
I'm thinking to learn more about the framework.

Notes:

 * LATER: `Batman.Model.storageKey` behaves unexpectely when it starts '/'.
 * Can remove: `collectionJsonNamespace: false`
 * WANTED: batman: A debug message when the requested controler api isn't found.
 * WANTED: batman: A way to render existing subtree, instead of a remote source.
 * WANTED: batman: A debug message for missing bound keys.
 * WANTED: load_if_dirty or @dirty
