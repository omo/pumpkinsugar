So I'd proceed to implement 'exercise mode', which distinguish Anki-based flashcard from others.
I need to extend the data model to support it.

During the change, I noticed that the app uses `webapp2` incorrectly. 
It should use named capturing for its routing. But I didn't. 
The half of todays work was spent for the rewrite. I hope my microframework be more stable.

Anyway, I did a small addition to the server-side model. 
Tomorrow I'll come back to the client side and play with batman again.
