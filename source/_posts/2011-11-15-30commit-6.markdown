I trapped my miss-asumption how model works. 
I took a day for tweaking the server side API to follow the convention.

 * https://github.com/omo/blbr/commit/2e867a004a5a5afe60ef7a12d4aeaf04081c4dc9

Notes:

 * Batman.js has `instanceof 'function'` pattern. should be extracted.
 * `Model.find` should accept `option` instead of `id`? -> It's acceptable
 * `Model.url` should be able to function? -> `constructor.url` is a function. Wow.
 * `@::hasStorage() and @classState() not in ['loaded', 'loading']` in `Model.load` should be extracted
 * Want to know when exception is thrown (especially `developer.assert`): 
 * `Model.fromJSON` should reflect zero numeric value. to use binding.
