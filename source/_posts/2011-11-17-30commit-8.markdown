Today I worked till late and have little time for this project.
So I tried to fix a small bug of Batman.js. 
I pulled the tree, opened the file, and saw the problematic part...
but it was already fixed. Wow, their development is so active.
Then I just upgraded my copy to ToT. That's all what I did today.

By the way, the disk on my PC looks broken. 
I should replace it.
