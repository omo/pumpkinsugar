Implemented `Card.pass` and `Card.fail`. 

My current policy on responsibility sharing of c/s is "minimizing the server's logic."
So I added these on the client side. I think it's OK for this type of personal tools.
But for more competitive or game-like stuff,
we'd need to mirror these logic on the client and the server.
My negligence here should be a reasonable choice though.

Anyway, I'll finally come back to UI stuff tomorrow. Yay!
