Hmm. I wrote certain code at the last Sunday.
I did [a small Batman upstreaming](https://github.com/Shopify/batman/commit/2af8f8a1471bab6669e764d17053806d46eb09d0) at the Monday.
I did nothing a the Tuesday since the PC was broken. 
I recovered the checkout to work for my renewed Ubuntu setup.

The project is stalling.
I can't code tomorrow since it's an off-site event.
But I'm tired to make a plea. I should push the project forward.

What I should do? To add a "round" UI. Which I was failed to do it at the Sunday.
I'd try it today. Only one hour is left for me but...

Not enough. But it's better than nothing.
