Had a few day-length blank ...

 * 24(Thu): One-day off,
 * 25(Fri): Sabotage. #1 Penalty issued. I'll pay this at the end and...
 * 26(Sat): It's today.

Today I wrote some UI code. I'm struggling Data-binding based UI.
I started wondering whether this is a good idea. Aren't templates enough for us?
One friend who was good at WPF told me that he gave up WPF's data binding since its 
programing model was unintuitive and non-ideomatic. 
He mentioned the strange collection API and its consequence. 
I'm feeling exactly same about `Batman.Hash` and `Batman.Property`. 
But I'll explore more about this, by actually using and being suffered by this.
Because my understanding of this topics is far from sufficient to discuss further.

Actually, my opportunitism somehow expect this be just a pain of learning.
