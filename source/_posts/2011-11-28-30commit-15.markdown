To organize UI, I added some `route()` to the App. 
But I couldn't figure out how I can give a view for specific action
in reasonable manner. Then the night expired today's slot.

NOTE:

 * `Batman.App.classMixin.route()` is tricky and should be clarified.
 * Want a mechanism for checking if registered route option is valid.
 * `Controller.render`: Want to specify view name by the string.
