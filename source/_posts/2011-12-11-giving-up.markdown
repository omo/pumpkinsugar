I'm giving up 30commit. The experiment failed. 
I just donated 7000JPY to [jrc](http://www.jrc.or.jp/). 

I couldn't keep the momentum. Here is a guess why:

 * I was uncomfortable to work with current codebase settings, especially with Batman.js.
   The framework was apparently on too early stage for me to rely on. Often time, I was blocked coding by need for searching the Batman way.
 * December wasn't good for this kind of experiment. There were so many end-year-like parties at nights and weekends.
 * I couldn't love what I'm working on. I guess that's because I didn't care about its appearance at all. 
   On my last hobby project, I was too focused on the appearance and didn't push code forward then failed. 
   An opposite happened at this time.
 * My daytime project required me more energy than I expected before.

Essentially, this is because I'm not a good web developer: Neigther skilled, enthusiastic nor focused.
There are manything that could be better. 

Regardless of this experiment, I need some web app which I can play with all the time. 
So I'll continue with blbr. But maybe I discard current client-side codebase and rewrite it.
