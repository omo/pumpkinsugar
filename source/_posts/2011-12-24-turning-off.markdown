Since Google+ went public, I've been trying to "share" stuff there.
Then, as a side effect, the media addiction cahght me again. I
inherently turned Twitter and Facebook on too, which I'd been disabled
before I started G+. I no longer able to ignore people being over there.

I realized that I'm less tolerant to deal with these social media.
They catch, and never release me. I thought I could somehow live with
them because some disciplined people can - even without any significant
hassle. But it isn't my case.

So for a while, I'll turn my social media off again. Current plan is
to do it until end of next January. I'm not sure what happens after
that.  Note that I'll write blogs and read mails. Please send me a
mail if you need to contact me.

It's a shame as a person who is working for the Web to giving up his
battle field, even just a part of it.  But I cannot afford
it. It's about my inner tendency which I'm hardly able to control.  I
finally cannot become a "Web Native".

I just finished reading this fairly short book about media consumption. 
(You can purchase it also from [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019978.do) BTW.) 
The author introduces "diet" metaphor to the media consumption,
and discusses a way to conscious information consumption based on that idea.

I feel more sense to it than to one of "addiction".
Although the social media (and addictive media in general)
can be taken as something like alcohol, drug or smoking, it would be more
meaningful to think the phenomena as a part of information consumption, and
taking that consumption like eating food. It will give us a broader perspective.

Because the book isn't written by a software developer,
his interest is different from mine and his strategy isn't directly
applicable to me. But he is making a good point: Applying [food
pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_guide_pyramid) idea to the
information consumption.  That means we can and should be conscious about the
balance of information to take.  What is carbohydrates, vegetables,
oils, meats of information? We won't be sure.  But one idea, that is
proposed by the author, is that thinking the bottom of the pyramid 
as original sources of the information, and top as a "processed" one. 
That sounds making sense. 

Coming from the politics/government field,
the author emphasizes the importance of the originality of information. 
For us developers though, I think it's fine to take "well cooked" information.
But yes, the balance and ingredient matter as much as such field.

I need to think more about the "balance". This book gives me a ground.
