For the language training, I'd choose the textbook of this month: [究極の英語学習法 K/H System (入門編)](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4757403054).

Regardless of the title, the reviews are highly positive. And it looks
matching my expectation which wants to learn about the way to listening and understanding the stream of words.
This book is almost all about shadowing. I'll write a detailed review once I finish this book.


This book tells me that I should have a training for an hour per day. But it seems too long just for shadowing. 
I won't be able to have such long course anyway...

Back to the topic, 
the text asks me to record my speaking and score it.
So I use this [Android app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tokasiki.android.voicerecorder&hl=en) to record it.
And my iPod plays the sound to shadow.
I hope I have a voice recording device. I'll buy it if I can stay this training for a week. (Well, people need rewards...)
Hre is my first score: 102/323. 

The lower score is better and the goal is 5. Sounds far from here,
doesn't it?  According to the textbook, an expected time to reach the
goal is within 1-2 weeks assuming one hour training per day.

I'll score it for every two days because scoring is a bit too tedious
to do everyday. But I'll record my speaking once a day, for a record.
It will also drive me to the shining recording device ;-)
