On the K/H textbook (#2)
--------------------------

There is no score for today. How I can learn this is not on the
track yet. I'm experimenting a way to "focus where I was wrong" by 

 * Listening the speech with reading the transcript
 * Do shadowing on the underline (wrong) parts
   * At first with reading,
   * Then without reading text.
   * Repeat shadowing it (without text) until I can shadow it without flaw.
 * Move forward...

It looks to work. It's felt almost like just a remembering, not shadowing though. 
The textbook says that it is OK to remember the text if you can do "the perfect" shadowing.
Maybe it makes sense because at least a part of understanding is remembering.

By the way, I feel that I should timebox this. One of my friend
recommended me to use some mobile "pomodoro" apps for this purpose.
I'll try some of them. On length, one slot per day looks sufficient
for me.  So I'll use one slot as a base and two slots for a strech
goal. (Excluding weekends. it's reserved for margins.)
