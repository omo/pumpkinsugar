On the [K/H book](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4757403054) (#3), the score today was 34/323. it was getting better since I
actually start remembering the script... For some part, I couldn't shadow it
not because it was too fast to listen, but because it was too fast to speak.
I realized that my tongue becomes a bottleneck.

By the way, I finished [The Jingles
book](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/481253206X).  This is actually an
interesting material. The training is focusing on a few specific
phonetics.  The readers are asked to read aloud repeatedly some artificial
sentences which contain these phones. It seemsmaking sense for me. 
At least this lets my voice out daily that is,
in my understanding, essential to learn foreign languages.
Maybe I should proceed the next book in the same series. 
For daily use, I put transcripts of typical training material on the wall in my room.

A friend who told this book to me pointed out that pronunciation matters less in practice, 
so that what you get from the book will be just a feeling of confidence. 
But it does matter at least for me.
Being uncomfortable is one of the typical mental blocks on speaking foreign languages.
Also, I now can be aware of such phonetics like "th", "z", "t", "ou", etc. thanking the training.
