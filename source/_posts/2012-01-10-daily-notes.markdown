On the K/H book (#4), I was focusin on the pressures and rhythms. I'll
do same for more two days.  It's becoming more and more like
remembering stuff. But it's kinda interesting to see the detail like
pressures. The rhythm of high-pressure part is not uniform. 
And I guess that's why I need to excersize it repeatedly.

I'm start worrying that my neighbor is getting annoyed and may start
blaming. But I have no idea to keep myself quiet.
